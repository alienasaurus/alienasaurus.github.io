    <h4>Welcome, dear nomad of the web. We greet you with the utmost respect. This small domain may appear insignificant, merely a small repose, and perhaps it is.<br>But you must know that it holds a greater purpose, even if only to a small few, and that if you use your mind and accept the great Lord of Cheese's wisdom, it will reveal itself.<br>With that knowledge, you'll witness the inception of a new path. And if you choose to harness that enigmatic knowledge, thus stepping through this portal, you shall enter the realm of cheesy delight.<br>But do not be careless, as from this point in cheesetime and onwards must never defy the sacred cheese order. Whatever you do, you must never spill the cheesebeans.</h4>
